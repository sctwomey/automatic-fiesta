# Challenge 18: Social Network API

## Description
This challenge requires the development of a social network API that uses a NoSQL database (MondoDB with Mongoose). This is so that the website can handle a large amount of unstructured data. The application will be a command line/terminal application that when invoked will start the server, syncing the Mongoose models with the MondoDB database. There are no seed file required for this application.

When the API is opened in Insomnia for the API GET routes for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes will be displayed in a formatted JSON. The API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia, and are successfully shown to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the MongoDB database. The API POST and DELETE routes for friends and reactions are shown to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add or remove friends to and from a user's friend list.

This is a video walkthrough of the application:
